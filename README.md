# BFA Mythic Mechanics

This repository exists so I can have an easy TL;DR reference for each fight in mythic dungeons.

I'm not sure how I'll format things yet but this is gonna be a test. I'm gonna start with all the dungeons in the same file, but when that gets too lengthy I'll turn this file into an index for all the other files. To start with, this is just going to be for DPS.

#### Phase 1
* Don't stand between Charge swirlie and boss
* Unavoidable pistol damage
#### Phase 2
* Don't step in green stuff
* Don't stand in cone for Azerite Powder Shot
* Keep an eye on parrot so you can avoid dive bombs
* Interrupt Krag when he drinks brew
### Council o' Captains
#### Captain Raoul
